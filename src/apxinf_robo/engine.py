"""The one module that loads and runs the ApxInf engine.

Other modules here import ApxInf for *vocabulary* -- the ``Policy`` protocol, the
``ProcessorStep`` base class, ``Finding``, ``VIEW_SLOTS`` -- which is shared type
information and belongs where it is used. What they do not do is construct an
engine, allocate a device, or serve one. That happens here and only here, so the
dependency on a specific engine build is a single file: pinning a new submodule
SHA means reading one diff, and a compatibility shim for an engine API change
has exactly one place to live.

ApxInf exposes two interfaces, and this is where a caller picks one:

``interface="policy"`` (**default**, L2)
    ``AutoPolicy.from_pretrained(...)`` -> ``Policy.infer(obs) -> {actions, ...}``.
    The engine runs its own resize / tokenize / normalize / noise chain — the
    numerically anchored one, covered by ApxInf's golden tests. Use this unless
    you have a reason not to.

``interface="bare"`` (L1)
    ``apxinf.Model.load(...)`` -> ``Model.infer_rgb(rgb_u8, layout, token_ids,
    noise=)``. The caller supplies already-preprocessed tensors. This exists for
    frameworks that bring their own transforms (RLinf's vendored openpi, for
    instance) and do not want a second implementation of them in the loop.

The two paths must agree. That is not automatic — nothing in either repository
checks it — which is why ``tests/test_parity.py`` exists and is the reason this
package is worth having.
